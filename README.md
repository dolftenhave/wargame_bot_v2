# wargame_bot_v2

A complete rewrite of my original discord bot.

## Discord

### Commands

All commands are stored in the [`commands.json`](./discord/commands.json) file. You can find more information on how they work on the [discord developer documentaion site](https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/application-commands).

## TODO
- Move settings to a single file
- Enable live chat reading
- Have server states.
